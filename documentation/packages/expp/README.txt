'expp' README by Claude SIMON.
------------------------------------------------------
'expp' is an XML preprocessor from the Epeios project (http://zeusw.org/epeios/).

'expp' is published under GNU General Public Licesnse (see LICENSE file).

The windows binary is provided with this package ('expp.exe').

For GNU/Linux, cygwin (and theoritically Mac OS), unpack the archive, then launch 'make'.

In the package are also '.xcfg' and '.xlcl' files which have to be in the same directory as the binary one. 

'expp' without arguments waits for data on the standard input.

Launch 'expp --help' to obtain a help page.

See enclosed PDF files or go to 'http://zeusw.org/intl/expp/' for more details.

The 'linux.xcf', 'windows.xcf' et 'common.xcf' are example files.

Launch 'expp linux.xcf' or 'expp windows.xcf' to use them. 'common.xcf' is used by 'windows.xcf' and 'linux.xcf'.
